 *
 * Three inline marks over the prose R2 stores as plain strings -- a
 * bracket-and-paren link, a doubled-star bold, a single-star italic -- and
 * nothing block-level. The page is a hand-tuned editorial layout, and remote
 * JSON must not be able to put a heading or a list into the middle of it.
