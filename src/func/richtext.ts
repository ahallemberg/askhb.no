/*
 * Twin of admin.askhb.no's src/func/richtext.ts. The logic is a copy and the two
 * change together, the same arrangement func/text.ts and func/organisations.ts
 * already use: the editor's preview has to parse by the rules the site renders
 * by, or the preview is confidently wrong. Only the indentation and these
 * comments differ -- that repo indents src/func at two spaces -- so `diff -w`
 * between them should show comment blocks and nothing else. Anything more is
 * drift, and drift here makes the preview lie.
 *
 * Three inline marks over the prose R2 stores as plain strings -- a
 * bracket-and-paren link, a doubled-star bold, a single-star italic -- and
 * nothing block-level. The page is a hand-tuned editorial layout, and remote
 * JSON must not be able to put a heading or a list into the middle of it.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. That is load-bearing rather than tidy: Portfolio gates the
 * whole page on a single isError and there is no ErrorBoundary, so an exception
 * raised while rendering one description costs the reader every section.
